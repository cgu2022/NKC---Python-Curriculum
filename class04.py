#IMPORTANT:
# Remember: use int() to convert a string into an integer
# and use float() to convert a string with a decimal

# 4.1
# Write a program that uses a string variable and then prompts the user for a string. 
# If the strings match, print true. If not, print false. Then, do the same with a number. 

thing = "whatever you want"

# 4.2
# Write a program that takes in three numbers using the input function and then prints 
# the largest number.

# 4.3
# Write a program that takes in a grade and calculates if it is A, B, C, D, or F
# Extra: Added plus and minuses. Fs do not need + or -.
# This program will support decimals.
# Use round() to round the number. Although the function will round 1.5 down, 
# for our purposes, round it up.

# A straight in poker(a card game) is defined when 5 cards are aligned consecutively in 
# ascending order (0, 1, 2, 3, 4) but not (8, 9, 10, 0, 1), nor (0, 2, 1, 3, 4).
# Cards are from 0-10, and a J is 11.

# Write a program prompts the user for 5 numbers, and then determines if they are a 
# straight. You do not need to make sure the number stays within bounds.

# Write a program that prompts the user for an operation
# (addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division) for (0-3)
#     0          1              2               3
# and then prompts for 2 numbers. Then, display the result.

# e.g. Enter a number: 3 (for division)
#   Enter num1: 50
#   Enter num2: 10
#   5

# Triangles have exactly three sides. If a triangle has three equal sides it is called 
# an equilateral triangle. If a triangle has exactly two equal sides it is called an 
# isosceles triangle. If a triangle has three unequal sides it is called a scalene triangle.
# The sides of a triangle must have a certain relationship to one another in order for 
# them to form a valid triangle. The relationship is that the sum of any two sides must 
# be strictly greater than the third side. Sides must be a whole number.

# Write a program that prompts the user to enter some integer values for the 3 sides 
# of a triangle and then displays the values and the type of triangle they represent.
# If the user enters values that do not make a valid triangle, or if any values are not 
# greater than zero, then the program will invalidate that triangle by saying: 
# “This isn’t a real triangle!”

# Write a program to solve quadratic equations (use if, else if and else).
# Essentially, ask the user for a, b, and c
# If there are no real solutions, just say "No Real Solutions!"
# And remember, to determine if the solutions are real, just make sure the discriminate 
# (b^2 - 4*a*c) is greater than or equal to zero. 
# useful math functions:
# math.pow - get powers of numbers - ex: math.pow(2, 3) = 8
# math.sqrt - get square root of number - ex: math.sqrt(4) = 2
